üëçüéâ Thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç


## What languages can you use

In this project, you have to use  *English* for exchanging, coding and documenting. 

*Esperanto*, *French*, *Portuguese* and others languages are only used for translating the rules.

All languages are welcome for translating the rules.

## What can you contribute

* You can start a translation of the rules in a new language.
* You can correct an existing translation.
* You can propose clarification on the rules.
* You can fix coding errors in files (HTML, CSS, ...).
* You can correct the wording in the documentation files.
* You can propose evolution of the rules if the following principles stay satisfied:
  * game easily made by hand,
  * defined by a few rules,
  * without randomizing device.

## How do you exchange

You can exchange by:

* Reporting error or proposing enhancement using the [GitHub](https://github.com) ticketing solution at [baltek-the-rules/issues](https://github.com/LucasBorboleta/baltek-the-rules/issues).
* Proposing code using the [GitHub](https://github.com) pull-request solution at [baltek-the-rules/pulls](https://github.com/LucasBorboleta/baltek-the-rules/pulls).

## How do you get started

* Read the introductory [README](./README.md) document.
* Play the rules, either manually or using [baltek-the-program](https://github.com/LucasBorboleta/baltek-the-program).
* Create a  [GitHub](https://github.com)  account. This is the prerequisite for issuing a ticket.
* If you intent to propose code, then:
  * Learn how to use  [GitHub](https://github.com) in some sandbox project.
  * Read all sections of this document about files, testing...
* Read the [CODE-OF-CONDUCT](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) document about expected behavior of contributors. A translation in your native language can be found at https://www.contributor-covenant.org.


## How do you find and store files

Here is the organization of the files:

* All documentation files (README, LICENSE...) are located at the root of the project. They are named with capitalized letters leading to words joined with `-` but not with `_`. Their extensions are either *.txt* or `.md`.
* The main files are grouped and stored as packages in the `./packages` folder. The present project is the `baltek-the-rules` package. The other packages correspond to imported projects.
* Beneath each package root, the following subfolders group the files according to their types: `html`, `css`, `js`, `pictures`. Going deeper, sub-subfolders  might be created if they bring added value.
* Links between files of the `./packages` folder are always expressed using relative paths.
* At the root of the project, files named `index-en.html`, `index-eo.html`... using a minimal amount of code launches the  `./packages/baltek-the-rules` package.
* The `LICENSE.txt` stored at the root of the project is also copied at the root of the   `./packages/baltek-the-rules` package.

## How do you test

New and modified HTML files have to be tested manually as follows:

* The [W3C HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org) checks the files without any error.
* All hyperlinks are checked with success. 
* The files are  readable using at least two browsers amongst Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera.
* The files printed as PDF are readable.

## How do you register contributors

The [CONTRIBUTORS.txt](./CONTRIBUTORS.txt) file registers the Baltekians who are the people have contributed in one of the following ways to the project:

* People who reported issues, then being treated.
* People who proposed code, then being integrated.
* People outside GitHub who get known for their feedbacks as game testers or linguistic correctors.

Developer creating or merging a pull-request, or treating an issue, is responsible for updating the [CONTRIBUTORS.txt](./CONTRIBUTORS.txt) file with involved Baltekians.
