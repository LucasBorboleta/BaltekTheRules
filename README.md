## Introduction

This project, named **baltek-the-rules**, describes the **rules** of the **BALTEK** board game.

BALTEK is a turn-based board game, inspired from **football**. Here are its principles:

- Game easily made by hand,
- defined by a few rules,
- without randomizing device.
- The game allows several actions per turn.
- The ball moves faster than the footballers.
- The coordination of footballers is essential.

The name of the game is built using sounds of the words ball (BAL) and technical (TEK).

The **atmosphere** of the matches is reminiscent of the game of **chess**.

## Usages

- In order to read the rules: open the file [index.html](./index.html) in your web browser.

- In order to play the rules, either:

  - handcraft yourself the game (it is really easy!),
  - play the HTML5/JavaScript implementation developed in the sister project [baltek-the-program](https://github.com/LucasBorboleta/baltek-the-program).

## History

During year 2015, the rules of the game have been tested within the limited circle of my family and office colleagues. The rules have been found balanced and fun.

Such tests were performed using handcrafted material (paper sheet and wooden pieces). See also the [pictures](http://lucas.borboleta.blog.free.fr/public/Baltek/2016-01--Baltek-Prototype-2/Diaporama.htm) from the blog [Lucas Borboleta](http://lucas.borboleta.blog.free.fr)

During year 2016, an implementation using HTML and JavaScript was started. Such implementation is hosted in another project, named [baltek-the-program](https://github.com/LucasBorboleta/baltek-the-program).

During year 2017, the rules have been translated in English, Esperanto and Portuguese.

During year 2018, the project has been prepared for being ready for contributions.

The **separation** of **text rules** and **software implementation** aims at encouraging people either to play using handcrafted material or to develop their own program
