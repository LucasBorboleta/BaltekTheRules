    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

    <p>BALTEK is a turn-based board game, inspired from football. Here are its principles:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Game easily made by hand,</li>
        <li>defined by a few rules,</li>
        <li>without randomizing device.</li>
        <li>The game allows several actions per turn.</li>
        <li>The ball moves faster than the footballers.</li>
        <li>The coordination of footballers is essential.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The name of the game is built using sounds of the words <q>ball</q> (BAL) and <q>technical</q> (TEK).</p>

    <h1 id="material">Material</h1>

    <div class="baltek-rules-hasImage-class">
        <img alt="starting-positions-with-coordinates" class="baltek-rules-image-class" src="../pictures/starting-positions-with-coordinates.png">
    </div>

    <p>Here is the material, shown in the image above:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 white ball, with the label <q>@</q>.</li>
        <li>A team of 6 blue footballers.</li>
        <li>A team of 6 red footballers.</li>
        <li>Each team consists of:
            <ul>
                <li>1 centre forward of force 3.</li>
                <li>2 wingers of force 2.</li>
                <li>3 fullbacks of force 1.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The field is built using 52 green squares.</li>
        <li>The square <q>a3</q>, with the label <q>#</q>, is the goal defended by the blue team.</li>
        <li>The square <q>l3</q>, with the label <q>#</q>, is the goal defended by the red team.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The coordinates and the labels, <q>@</q> and <q>#</q>, are used for notation of moves.</p>

    <h1 id="purpose">Purpose</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>BALTEK is played by two players.</li>
        <li>Each player leads a team of 6 footballers.</li>
        <li>In turn, each player moves the ball and his/her footballers, trying to send the ball into the opponent's goal.</li>
        <li>The winner is the player who first scored 2 goals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="howtoStart">How to start</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>The players decide the leader of each team.</li>
        <li>The blue team always starts the match.</li>
        <li>At the beginning of the game, as well as after each scored goal, the footballers move at their kickoff positions.</li>
        <li>The kickoff positions are fixed.</li>
        <li>The kickoff positions of the two teams are symmetrical, except those of the centre forwards.</li>
        <li>The team that has just scored a goal lets the other team kicks off.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following picture shows the kickoff positions of the blue team.</p>

    <div class="baltek-rules-hasImage-class">

    <h1 id="howToPlay">How to play</h1>

    <h2>Actions, options, compensations, credits and bonuses</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>In turn, each player chooses actions and options, which, depending on the context, require compensations.</li>
        <li>These choices cost credits or bonuses.</li>
        <li>Each player receives:
            <ul>
                <li>3 credits, at the beginning of each turn;</li>
                <li>1 bonus, at each kickoff.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>In turn, each player can spend 0, 1, 2 or 3 credits, and 0 or 1 bonus.</li>
        <li>The actions, options and compensations are as follows:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Run</strong>: move a footballer; cost: <strong>1 credit</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Sprint</strong>: option to increase the move of a footballer; cost: <strong>1 bonus</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Shoot</strong>: move the ball; cost: <strong>1 credit</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Dribble</strong>: compensation of force to own the ball; cost: <strong>1 credit per unit of force</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Effect</strong>: compensation of force to move the ball; cost: <strong>1 credit per unit of force</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Action <q>run</q></h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The action <q>run</q> costs 1 credit and allows to move a footballer by 1 square.</li>
        <li>Each square of the zone 3 x 3, centered on the moved footballer, is a possible destination, unless:
            <ul>
                <li>it is outside the field;</li>
                <li>it is a goal square;</li>
                <li>it already hosts a footballer of the same team.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Each footballer can only <q>run</q> once per turn.</li>
        <li>The action <q>run</q> does not move the ball.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Example: the possible destinations for the blue 3 footballer have yellow borders.</p>

    <div class="baltek-rules-hasImage-class">
        <img alt="run-allowed-destinations" class="baltek-rules-image-class" src="../pictures/run-allowed-destinations.png">
   </div>

    <h2>Option <q>sprint</q></h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The option <q>sprint</q> costs 1 bonus and extends to 2 squares the move of a footballer.</li>
        <li>The option <q>sprint</q> must always be combined with the action <q>run</q>.</li>
        <li>Each square of the 5 x 5 zone, centered on the moved footballer, is a possible destination, unless:
            <ul>
                <li>it is outside the field;</li>
                <li>it is a goal square;</li>
                <li>it already hosts a footballer of the same team.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The player can only spend his/her bonus once between two kickoffs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Example: the possible destinations for the blue 3 footballer have yellow borders.</p>

    <div class="baltek-rules-hasImage-class">
        <img alt="sprint-allowed-destinations" class="baltek-rules-image-class" src="../pictures/sprint-allowed-destinations.png">
    </div>

    <h2>Action <q>shoot</q></h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            The actions <q>transmit the ball to a footballer</q>,
            <q>send the ball to an empty square</q> and <q>shoot at the goal</q> obey the same rules.
        </li>
        <li>
            The action <q>shoot</q> costs 1 credit.
            If the general conditions and the force conditions are satisfied,
            the action allows to move the ball up to 2 squares along horizontal,
            vertical or diagonal directions.
            However, the trajectory of the ball is never curved.
        </li>
        <li>Here are the general conditions to be met:
            <ul>
                <li>The player has a <q>shooter</q> in the starting square of the ball.</li>
                <li>In this turn, the <q>shooter</q> has not already <q>shot</q>.</li>
                <li>The arriving square of the ball is in the field.</li>
                <li>The arriving square of the ball is not the goal defended by the player.</li>
                <li>The arriving square of the ball may be empty or not.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Here are the force conditions to be met:
            <ul>
                <li>If the <q>shooter</q> shares his/ber square with an opponent, then the <q>shooter</q> must:
                    <ul>
                        <li>either equal or surpass the force of his/her opponent,</li>
                        <li>or compensate for his/ber inferiority by a <q>dribble</q>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If the <q>shooter</q> moves the ball over an opponent, then the <q>shooter</q> must:
                    <ul>
                        <li>either equal or surpass the force of his/her opponent,</li>
                        <li>or compensate for his/her inferiority by an <q>effect</q>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Example: the possible destinations for the ball by the blue 3 <q>shooter</q> have yellow borders;
        none of these destinations requires <q>dribble</q> or <q>effect</q>.
    </p>

    <div class="baltek-rules-hasImage-class">
        <img alt="shoot-allowed-destinations" class="baltek-rules-image-class" src="../pictures/shoot-allowed-destinations.png">
    </div>

    <h2>Compensation by <q>dribble</q></h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The action <q>shoot</q> may be require this compensation .</li>
        <li>The <q>dribble</q> compensates for the inferiority of the <q>shooter</q> with respect to the opponent sharing his/her square.</li>
        <li>The <q>dribble</q> costs 1 credit per unit of compensated force.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Examples: to own the ball, the blue 2 <q>shooter</q> must engage a <q>dribble</q> costing 1 credit;
        and the blue 1 <q>shooter</q> must engage a <q>dribble</q> costing 2 credits.
    </p>

    <div class="baltek-rules-hasImage-class">
        <img alt="requiring-dribble-of-one-credit" class="baltek-rules-image-class" src="../pictures/requiring-dribble-of-one-credit.png">

    </div>

    <h2>Compensation by <q>effect</q></h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The action <q>shoot</q> may be require this compensation .</li>
        <li>The <q>effect</q> compensates for the inferiority of the <q>shooter</q> with respect to the opponent over which the ball passes.</li>
        <li>The <q>effect</q> costs 1 credit per unit of compensated force.</li>
        <li>The compensation by <q>effect</q> is not necessary to pass over a footballer of his/her team.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Examples: to transmit the ball to the blue 2 footballer,
        the blue 1 <q>shooter</q> must perform an <q>effect</q> costing 1 credit in the left context
        and an <q>effect</q> costing 2 credits in the right context.
    </p>

    <h1 id="notationOfMoves">Notation of moves</h1>

    <p>If useful, the moves of the game are noted as in the following example.</p>

    <pre class="w3-code">
@d3  f3g3 d1e1  / h3g3 g5f5 i3h3
e1e2 d5e4 f5g4  / f5e4 g1f1 i1h2
@e4  @g4+       / g3g4 i5i4 @i4
...
@# /
    </pre>

    <p>Optionally, annotations are added as in the following example.</p>

    <pre class="w3-code">
#! BALTEK 1.1
#@ bernard@bois.fr robert@riviere.fr
#: 2014-12-24 11:09:30
@d3  f3g3 d1e1  / h3g3 g5f5 i3h3
e1e2 d5e4 f5g4  / f5e4 g1f1 i1h2
@e4  @g4+       / g3g4 i5i4 @i4
...
@# /
#: 2014-12-24 11:30:00
# The red bonus has been well played.
    </pre>

    <p>The notation is structured by rows. Here are its conventions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The space character , optionally repeated, separates the words.</li>

        <li>A line beginning with <q><code class="w3-codespan">#</code></q> is a comment or pseudo-comment, and is always optional.
            <ul>
                <li><q><code class="w3-codespan">#&nbsp;</code></q>, sharp followed by space, announces a free comment.</li>
                <li>
                    <q><code class="w3-codespan">#! BALTEK 1.1</code></q> announces the version <q>1.1</q> of the BALTEK notation format;
                    usable only once, in the first row.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <q><code class="w3-codespan">#@</code></q> announces the identifiers chosen by the two players,
                    in order <q>blue</q> then <q>red</q>; usable only once.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <q><code class="w3-codespan">#:</code></q> announces,
                    using an <q>ISO</q> format, the date, then optionally the time; usable several times.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>A non-empty line, which is not a comment, describes a <q>blue</q> turn, followed by a <q>red</q> turn.</li>
        <li><q><code class="w3-codespan">/</code></q> ends the <q>blue</q> turn. The end of the line ends the <q>red</q> turn .</li>

        <li>Each turn is composed of 0, 1, 2 ou 3 actions.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The action <q>run</q> is noted using one word beginning with the starting square and ending with the arriving square.
                    Example: <code class="w3-codespan">g3f3</code>
                </li>
                <li>For noting the <q>sprint</q>, <q>*</q> is appended to the action word. Example: <code class="w3-codespan">g3e2*</code></li>
                <li>
                    The action <q>shot</q> is noted using one word beginning with <q>@</q> and ending with the arriving square.
                    Example: <code class="w3-codespan">@c3</code>
                </li>
                <li>The action <q>shot at goal</q> is abbreviated as follows: <code class="w3-codespan">@#</code></li>
                <li>For a <q>dribble</q> costing 1 credit, <q>+</q> is appended to the action word. Example: <code class="w3-codespan">@c3+</code></li>
                <li>For a <q>dribble</q> costing 2 credits, <q>++</q> is appended to the action word. Example: <code class="w3-codespan">@c3++</code></li>
                <li>For an <q>effect</q> costing 1 credit, <q>!</q> is appended to the action word. Example: <code class="w3-codespan">@c3!</code></li>
                <li>For an <q>effect</q> costing 2 credits, <q>!!</q> is appended to the action word. Example: <code class="w3-codespan">@c3!!</code></li>
                <li>
                    For a combination <q>dribble</q> and <q>effect</q>, each one costing 1 credit, <q>+!</q> is appended to the action word.
                    Example: <code class="w3-codespan">@c3+!</code>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="indexesOfVersions">Indexes of versions</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>The versions of the rules are identified by two integer indices <q>i.j</q>.</li>
        <li>The first version is <q>1.0</q>.</li>
        <li>When the logic of the rules changes, the first index <q>i</q> is incremented by 1, and the second index <q>j</q> is reset to 0.</li>
        <li>
            The second index <q>j</q> is incremented by 1 when the texts or the illustrations or the notation of moves or the structure of the document evolve,
            or a translation is added, but without changing the logic of the rules.
        </li>
